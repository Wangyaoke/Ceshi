The increase in the length of the root is referred to as primary growth, while secondary growth is the increase in thickness or girth of the root.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tBecause root growth confers a metabolic cost to the plant, bean plants growing in phosphorus-depleted soils that send out longer, thinner roots have an advantage in exploring a greater volume of soil and acquiring more phosphorus.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t\"As a natural strategy for plants to deal with phosphorus stress, it's a winner,\" said lead researcher Christopher Strock, a plant biology doctoral student in the College of Agricultural Sciences.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t\"That's important because most soils throughout the world are phosphorus deficient, and root traits that improve phosphorus acquisition not only can help to improve the efficiency of fertilizer uptake for farmers here in the U.S., but also benefit farmers in developing countries who do not have access to phosphate fertilizers.\"\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tResearchers used the common bean as a model for this research because it is one of the most fundamental crops contributing to food security, with greater volume for direct human consumption than any other grain legume. It is especially important throughout the developing world in sub-Saharan Africa and Central and South America, where people don't have wide access to animal protein. In those regions, beans are a primary source of protein and nutrition.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tDespite the significance of this crop, yields throughout much of the world are constrained by soils that are acidic and extremely depleted in phosphate, one of the main nutrients that plants need to grow.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t\"If we can identify root traits that improve foraging efficiency, we can develop new cultivars that have greater ability to take up phosphorus, and have improved yields in these environments,\" Strock said.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tIn conducting the study, which was published in this month's issue of Plant Physiology, researchers used computer-modeling techniques and grew recombinant, inbred lines of common bean to understand how plants allocate resources to primary and secondary root growth under phosphorus stress. Plants were grown in both greenhouse conditions - at Penn State's University Park campus - and in select fields at the University's Russell E. Larson Agricultural Research Center at Rock Springs.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tNormally, Pennsylvania soils would contain too much phosphorus to allow for field experiments on phosphorus stress, but University Distinguished Professor of Plant Science Jonathan Lynch's research group developed a technique to create experimental plots that replicate the phosphorus-depleted conditions of tropical oxisol soils at the Larson facility. This was accomplished by adding truckloads of aluminum oxide pellets to the fields, which binds phosphorus in the soil, making it unavailable to plants.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tAlso unique to the Lynch lab is its use of laser ablation tomography to section and measure root anatomy. This revolutionary technique, invented by the Lynch lab, not only allows for greater precision in observations of root anatomy, but also affords researchers the ability to rapidly sample hundreds of root samples per day - a task that would necessitate an impractical amount of labor and time using traditional methods.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tDifferences in bean plant growth observed by researchers were striking. In the phosphorus stress treatment, the genotypes with greater reduction of their secondary root growth had increased root length, took up more phosphorus, and had larger shoots than genotypes with greater secondary root growth.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t\"All of the genotypes we looked at suppressed their secondary root growth under phosphorus stress, but some showed this response much more strongly than others,\" said Strock.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t\"And those that suppressed their secondary growth the most, performed better under phosphorus stress because they were able to take the resources they would be putting into secondary growth and increasing root length to forage for more phosphorus.\"\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tLynch noted that his research group collaborates directly with plant breeders at the U.S. Department of Agriculture and agricultural centers in Columbia, Honduras, Mozambique, Zambia and Malawi. Breeders are currently incorporating other discoveries from his lab and are releasing several new varieties of bean with improved root traits for phosphorus acquisition to farmers in Mozambique and Zambia.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t\"Our goal in this lab is to identify traits like reduced secondary root growth that we can pass along to breeders so that they can incorporate them into their breeding programs,\" Lynch said.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t\"Working with our breeding partners, varieties of common bean can be developed that have reduced secondary root growth and therefore better yield in poor soils, which will be a huge benefit for small-holder farmers, who rely on beans for food and income.\"\n<\/p>","remarks":"","source":"太空新闻日报","isusetime":"2018-02-19 22:53:43","pkey":731,"type":"P","imgpath":"http://pyspider-crawl-image-v01.oss-cn-qingdao.aliyuncs.com/seeddaily.com/2018/01/bd85454c7043f0d83888c4c425fc111a0.jpg?x-oss-process=image/resize,m_mfit,h_150,w_200","iskey":"N","selftype":"P","description":"Bean plants that suppress secondary root growth in favor of boosting primary root growth forage greater soil volume to acquire phosphorus, according to Penn State researchers, who say their recent findings have implications for plant breeders and improving crop productivity in nutrient-poor soils.

The study was published Dec. 7 in the journal Science.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tThe team constructed a gate that controls interactions between the electrons in a way that allows them to act as the quantum bits of information, or qubits, necessary for quantum computing. The demonstration of this nearly error-free, two-qubit gate is an important early step in building a more complex quantum computing device from silicon, the same material used in conventional computers and smartphones.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t\"We knew we needed to get this experiment to work if silicon-based technology was going to have a future in terms of scaling up and building a quantum computer,\" said Jason Petta, a professor of physics at Princeton University. \"The creation of this high-fidelity two-qubit gate opens the door to larger scale experiments.\"\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tSilicon-based devices are likely to be less expensive and easier to manufacture than other technologies for achieving a quantum computer. Although other research groups and companies have announced quantum devices containing 50 or more qubits, those systems require exotic materials such as superconductors or charged atoms held in place by lasers.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tQuantum computers can solve problems that are inaccessible with conventional computers. The devices may be able to factor extremely large numbers or find the optimal solutions for complex problems. They could also help researchers understand the physical properties of extremely small particles such as atoms and molecules, leading to advances in areas such as materials science and drug discovery.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tBuilding a quantum computer requires researchers to create qubits and couple them to each other with high fidelity. Silicon-based quantum devices use a quantum property of electrons called \"spin\" to encode information. The spin can point either up or down in a manner analogous to the north and south poles of a magnet. In contrast, conventional computers work by manipulating the electron's negative charge.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tAchieving a high-performance, spin-based quantum device has been hampered by the fragility of spin states - they readily flip from up to down or vice versa unless they can be isolated in a very pure environment. By building the silicon quantum devices in Princeton's Quantum Device Nanofabrication Laboratory, the researchers were able to keep the spins coherent - that is, in their quantum states - for relatively long periods of time.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tTo construct the two-qubit gate, the researchers layered tiny aluminum wires onto a highly ordered silicon crystal. The wires deliver voltages that trap two single electrons, separated by an energy barrier, in a well-like structure called a double quantum dot.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tBy temporarily lowering the energy barrier, the researchers allow the electrons to share quantum information, creating a special quantum state called entanglement. These trapped and entangled electrons are now ready for use as qubits, which are like conventional computer bits but with superpowers: while a conventional bit can represent a zero or a 1, each qubit can be simultaneously a zero and a 1, greatly expanding the number of possible permutations that can be compared instantaneously.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t\"The challenge is that it's very difficult to build artificial structures small enough to trap and control single electrons without destroying their long storage times,\" said David Zajac, a graduate student in physics at Princeton and first-author on the study.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t\"This is the first demonstration of entanglement between two electron spins in silicon, a material known for providing one of the cleanest environments for electron spin states.\"\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tThe researchers demonstrated that they can use the first qubit to control the second qubit, signifying that the structure functioned as a controlled NOT (CNOT) gate, which is the quantum version of a commonly used computer circuit component.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tThe researchers control the behavior of the first qubit by applying a magnetic field. The gate produces a result based on the state of the first qubit: If the first spin is pointed up, then the second qubit's spin will flip, but if the first spin is down, the second one will not flip.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t\"The gate is basically saying it is only going to do something to one particle if the other particle is in a certain configuration,\" Petta said. \"What happens to one particle depends on the other particle.\"\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tThe researchers showed that they can maintain the electron spins in their quantum states with a fidelity exceeding 99 percent and that the gate works reliably to flip the spin of the second qubit about 75 percent of the time.

Those efforts have targeted both nitric oxides and hydrocarbons. Nitric oxide is a compound of nitrogen and oxygen emitted from engines (especially those powered by diesel fuel) and from coal power plants. Hydrocarbons, meanwhile, are the family of molecules made from chaining together hydrogen and carbon. These molecules are emitted from many sources including gasoline-powered cars, trucks, solvents, cleaners used both at home and in industrial settings, and even trees.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tOne way researchers track the changing rates of nitric oxide emissions and hydrocarbon emissions is by examining the ratio of the levels of non-methane atmospheric hydrocarbons to those of nitric oxide (methane, a powerful greenhouse gas, is tracked separately). From 1987 and 1997, that ratio dropped by a factor of two.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tRegulations aimed at improving air quality in urban areas like Los Angeles have made rapid progress on reducing nitric oxide and hydrocarbon emissions. As old cars have been taken off the street in favor of cleaner new cars and diesel trucks have been retrofitted or replaced, nitric oxide emissions have dropped rapidly. Compared to 1970 models, new cars and trucks produce about 99 percent fewer common pollutants, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. During the last decade, for example, the amount of nitric oxide in Los Angeles's air has dropped by half.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tAir pollution regulations have also led to reductions in hydrocarbon emissions, but these decreases are slowing. Hydrocarbons come from a variety of sources, making it tougher to crack down on them. For example, these compounds are released by the two-cycle engines used in leaf blowers and lawn mowers - equipment that tends to stay in service longer than cars and is subject to fewer regulations.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tThe sharp drop in nitric oxide levels compared to the slower decline in hydrocarbons is important: according to a new study led by Caltech's Paul Wennberg and the University of Copenhagen's Henrik Kjaergaard, this disparity can lead to the production of chemicals called organic hydroperoxides.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tOrganic hydroperoxides already exist in nature. In rural areas and other regions that lack large amounts of engine exhaust - and therefore places where nitric oxide levels are exceedingly low - the molecules can form when trees off-gas volatile organic compounds that then interact with sunlight.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tThe team led by Wennberg found, however, that there is another chemical pathway for forming organic hydroperoxides - one that occurs at nitric oxide levels substantially higher than can be found in the atmosphere over unpopulated regions.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t\"This is chemistry that does not exist in any of the models of how nitric oxide and hydrocarbons interact,\" says Wennberg, Caltech's R. Stanton Avery Professor of Atmospheric Chemistry and Environmental Science and Engineering and director of the Ronald and Maxine Linde Center for Global Environmental Science.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tSignificantly, the atmospheric nitric oxide concentrations over Los Angeles and in urban regions across the country are now dropping to the levels at which this process - called gas-phase autoxidation - occurs.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tGas-phase autoxidation takes place when there are not enough nitric oxide molecules for hydrocarbons to react with. As a result, hydrocarbon molecules react with themselves. Gas-phase autoxidation has been observed in other settings - for example, the process can form skin-irritating organic hydroperoxides in certain cosmetic products that have gone bad and causes butter to go rancid and wine to spoil. But researchers had thought that it could not occur in the atmosphere, given current urban nitric oxide concentrations. Wennberg and colleagues have found otherwise.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t\"As these nitric oxide concentrations go down by another factor of two over the next five to seven years, we're going to start making more and more organic hydroperoxides in urban areas,\" Wennberg says. In the air, these hydroperoxides are known to form particulates - aerosols.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t\"The problem is that we haven't seen large concentrations of hydroperoxides in heavily populated areas, so we don't know how the formation of gas and aerosol hydroperoxides will impact public health. But we do know that breathing in particles tends to be bad for you,\" he says.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<!--FACEBOOK-->\n<\/p>","remarks":"","source":"太空新闻日报","isusetime":"2018-02-18 04:35:29","pkey":682,"type":"P","imgpath":"http://pyspider-crawl-image-v01.oss-cn-qingdao.aliyuncs.com/spacedaily.com/2018/01/628f1c1b56291985d978368fd5a06be60.jpg?x-oss-process=image/resize,m_mfit,h_150,w_200","iskey":"N","selftype":"P","description":"An imbalance between the trends in two common air pollutants is unexpectedly triggering the creation of a class of airborne organic compounds not usually found in the atmosphere over urban areas of North America, according to a new study from Caltech.","headImg":"","userid":0,"comnum":1,"vtime":"","imgArray":[],"thumbsUpNum":1,"shareNum":0,"collectionNum":0}]}

The increase in the length of the root is referred to as primary growth, while secondary growth is the increase in thickness or girth of the root.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tBecause root growth confers a metabolic cost to the plant, bean plants growing in phosphorus-depleted soils that send out longer, thinner roots have an advantage in exploring a greater volume of soil and acquiring more phosphorus.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t\"As a natural strategy for plants to deal with phosphorus stress, it's a winner,\" said lead researcher Christopher Strock, a plant biology doctoral student in the College of Agricultural Sciences.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t\"That's important because most soils throughout the world are phosphorus deficient, and root traits that improve phosphorus acquisition not only can help to improve the efficiency of fertilizer uptake for farmers here in the U.S., but also benefit farmers in developing countries who do not have access to phosphate fertilizers.\"\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tResearchers used the common bean as a model for this research because it is one of the most fundamental crops contributing to food security, with greater volume for direct human consumption than any other grain legume. It is especially important throughout the developing world in sub-Saharan Africa and Central and South America, where people don't have wide access to animal protein. In those regions, beans are a primary source of protein and nutrition.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tDespite the significance of this crop, yields throughout much of the world are constrained by soils that are acidic and extremely depleted in phosphate, one of the main nutrients that plants need to grow.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t\"If we can identify root traits that improve foraging efficiency, we can develop new cultivars that have greater ability to take up phosphorus, and have improved yields in these environments,\" Strock said.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tIn conducting the study, which was published in this month's issue of Plant Physiology, researchers used computer-modeling techniques and grew recombinant, inbred lines of common bean to understand how plants allocate resources to primary and secondary root growth under phosphorus stress. Plants were grown in both greenhouse conditions - at Penn State's University Park campus - and in select fields at the University's Russell E. Larson Agricultural Research Center at Rock Springs.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tNormally, Pennsylvania soils would contain too much phosphorus to allow for field experiments on phosphorus stress, but University Distinguished Professor of Plant Science Jonathan Lynch's research group developed a technique to create experimental plots that replicate the phosphorus-depleted conditions of tropical oxisol soils at the Larson facility.

The study was published Dec. 7 in the journal Science.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tThe team constructed a gate that controls interactions between the electrons in a way that allows them to act as the quantum bits of information, or qubits, necessary for quantum computing. The demonstration of this nearly error-free, two-qubit gate is an important early step in building a more complex quantum computing device from silicon, the same material used in conventional computers and smartphones.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t\"We knew we needed to get this experiment to work if silicon-based technology was going to have a future in terms of scaling up and building a quantum computer,\" said Jason Petta, a professor of physics at Princeton University. \"The creation of this high-fidelity two-qubit gate opens the door to larger scale experiments.\"\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tSilicon-based devices are likely to be less expensive and easier to manufacture than other technologies for achieving a quantum computer. Although other research groups and companies have announced quantum devices containing 50 or more qubits, those systems require exotic materials such as superconductors or charged atoms held in place by lasers.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tQuantum computers can solve problems that are inaccessible with conventional computers. The devices may be able to factor extremely large numbers or find the optimal solutions for complex problems. They could also help researchers understand the physical properties of extremely small particles such as atoms and molecules, leading to advances in areas such as materials science and drug discovery.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tBuilding a quantum computer requires researchers to create qubits and couple them to each other with high fidelity. Silicon-based quantum devices use a quantum property of electrons called \"spin\" to encode information. The spin can point either up or down in a manner analogous to the north and south poles of a magnet. In contrast, conventional computers work by manipulating the electron's negative charge.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tAchieving a high-performance, spin-based quantum device has been hampered by the fragility of spin states - they readily flip from up to down or vice versa unless they can be isolated in a very pure environment. By building the silicon quantum devices in Princeton's Quantum Device Nanofabrication Laboratory, the researchers were able to keep the spins coherent - that is, in their quantum states - for relatively long periods of time.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tTo construct the two-qubit gate, the researchers layered tiny aluminum wires onto a highly ordered silicon crystal. The wires deliver voltages that trap two single electrons, separated by an energy barrier, in a well-like structure called a double quantum dot.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tBy temporarily lowering the energy barrier, the researchers allow the electrons to share quantum information, creating a special quantum state called entanglement. These trapped and entangled electrons are now ready for use as qubits, which are like conventional computer bits but with superpowers: while a conventional bit can represent a zero or a 1, each qubit can be simultaneously a zero and a 1, greatly expanding the number of possible permutations that can be compared instantaneously.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t\"The challenge is that it's very difficult to build artificial structures small enough to trap and control single electrons without destroying their long storage times,\" said David Zajac, a graduate student in physics at Princeton and first-author on the study.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t\"This is the first demonstration of entanglement between two electron spins in silicon, a material known for providing one of the cleanest environments for electron spin states.\"\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tThe researchers demonstrated that they can use the first qubit to control the second qubit, signifying that the structure functioned as a controlled NOT (CNOT) gate, which is the quantum version of a commonly used computer circuit component.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tThe researchers control the behavior of the first qubit by applying a magnetic field. The gate produces a result based on the state of the first qubit: If the first spin is pointed up, then the second qubit's spin will flip, but if the first spin is down, the second one will not flip.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t\"The gate is basically saying it is only going to do something to one particle if the other particle is in a certain configuration,\" Petta said. \"What happens to one particle depends on the other particle.\"\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tThe researchers showed that they can maintain the electron spins in their quantum states with a fidelity exceeding 99 percent and that the gate works reliably to flip the spin of the second qubit about 75 percent of the time. The technology has the potential to scale to more qubits with even lower error rates, according to the researchers.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t\"This work stands out in a worldwide race to demonstrate the CNOT gate, a fundamental building block for quantum computation, in silicon-based qubits,\" said HongWen Jiang, a professor of physics and astronomy at the University of California-Los Angeles.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t\"The error rate for the two-qubit operation is unambiguously benchmarked.

The formulation may draw interest from the civilian fireworks and military pyrotechnics communities for further development as they both have a vested interest in the development of environmentally conscious formulations, stated ARL's Dr. Jesse J. Sabatini, a research chemist, who with the university's Professor Thomas M. Klapotke coauthored a paper in a recent edition of Angewandte Chemie.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tTo achieve red-light-emission of high color purity, the authors report a formulation consisting of powdered magnesium and hexamine as the fuels, nitrocellulose, an epoxy binder system, and a lithium-based high-nitrogen salt, which serves as both the oxidizer and colorant.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tWhen burned, this formulation was found to exhibit a relatively cool-burning flame, while producing suitable quantities of red-light-emitting atomic lithium. While further optimization is still needed to improve the luminosity of Li-based red-light-emitting flares, this represents the first known example of a successful red-light-emitting formulation of high color quality and purity based on lithium that does not contain any perchlorates, halogenated materials or strontium-based materials.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tHistorically, the formulations for red-light-emitting pyrotechnic formulations included powdered metal fuels like magnesium and aluminum, strontium nitrate and perchlorate oxidizers, as well as carbon-based chlorinated organic materials such as poly(vinyl) chloride.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t\"When these formulations are burned, a bright red light is produced; brought about by the generation of strontium(I) chloride (SrCl). SrCl is a deep red-light-emitter, and it is what's known as a metastable molecular emitter; an emitter that is not stable in the ground state at low temperatures, but which is stable in the excited state during a high temperature combustion process.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tUnfortunately, perchlorates, chlorinated organic materials and strontium-based materials found in traditional red-light-emitting pyrotechnic formulations are falling out of favor from an environmental perspective, and are facing increasing scrutiny and/or regulatory action from the EPA,\" said Sabatini.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tThe authors cited a recent EPA report that found strontium as potentially harmful to human health, specifically that it replaces calcium in the bone, interferes with bone strength, and thus affects the skeletal development of children and adolescents. In 2014, the EPA made a preliminary decision to start regulating the amount of strontium in drinking water.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tStrontium has been detected in 99?% of all public water systems and at levels of concern in 7?% of the public water systems in the USA. Whereas U.S. military training grounds were not included in the study, these facilities may show elevated concentrations of strontium as well, given the presence of strontium in currently used red-light-illuminating signaling pyrotechnic compositions.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tThe next step in this research is to make the strontium- and halogen-free red flare the team developed brighter, Sabatini said.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t\"In other words, efforts now need to be made to increase the luminous intensity of the formulation or a close derivative thereof. This can be done in parallel with doing what is called prototype experiments, in which the new flare formulations can be tested on larger scales. The improvements in luminosity and the large scale prototype tests will be needed in order to push the technology forward.\"\n<\/p>","remarks":"","source":"太空新闻日报","isusetime":"2018-02-18 04:35:17","pkey":670,"type":"P","imgpath":"http://pyspider-crawl-image-v01.oss-cn-qingdao.aliyuncs.com/spacewar.com/2018/01/fa960cbf0e180954f1f3c8d34ae944970.jpg?x-oss-process=image/resize,m_mfit,h_150,w_200","iskey":"N","selftype":"P","description":"Researchers at the U.S. Army Research Laboratory and the Ludwig Maximilian University in Munich, Germany have developed an environmentally-friendly red light flare popular in fireworks displays and among Soldiers who use them in training and battlefield operations as signaling devices.","headImg":"","userid":0,"comnum":0,"vtime":"","imgArray":[],"thumbsUpNum":0,"shareNum":0,"collectionNum":0},{"id":"NONE682","title":"Scientists discover unexpected side effect to cleaning up urban air","translateTitle":"","content":"<p>\n\tAn imbalance between the trends in two common air pollutants is unexpectedly triggering the creation of a class of airborne organic compounds not usually found in the atmosphere over urban areas of North America, according to a new study from Caltech.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tFor decades, efforts to reduce air pollution have led to cleaner air in U.S cities like Los Angeles, with subsequent improvements in public health. Those efforts have targeted both nitric oxides and hydrocarbons. Nitric oxide is a compound of nitrogen and oxygen emitted from engines (especially those powered by diesel fuel) and from coal power plants. Hydrocarbons, meanwhile, are the family of molecules made from chaining together hydrogen and carbon. These molecules are emitted from many sources including gasoline-powered cars, trucks, solvents, cleaners used both at home and in industrial settings, and even trees.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tOne way researchers track the changing rates of nitric oxide emissions and hydrocarbon emissions is by examining the ratio of the levels of non-methane atmospheric hydrocarbons to those of nitric oxide (methane, a powerful greenhouse gas, is tracked separately). From 1987 and 1997, that ratio dropped by a factor of two.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tRegulations aimed at improving air quality in urban areas like Los Angeles have made rapid progress on reducing nitric oxide and hydrocarbon emissions. As old cars have been taken off the street in favor of cleaner new cars and diesel trucks have been retrofitted or replaced, nitric oxide emissions have dropped rapidly. Compared to 1970 models, new cars and trucks produce about 99 percent fewer common pollutants, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. During the last decade, for example, the amount of nitric oxide in Los Angeles's air has dropped by half.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tAir pollution regulations have also led to reductions in hydrocarbon emissions, but these decreases are slowing. Hydrocarbons come from a variety of sources, making it tougher to crack down on them. For example, these compounds are released by the two-cycle engines used in leaf blowers and lawn mowers - equipment that tends to stay in service longer than cars and is subject to fewer regulations.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tThe sharp drop in nitric oxide levels compared to the slower decline in hydrocarbons is important: according to a new study led by Caltech's Paul Wennberg and the University of Copenhagen's Henrik Kjaergaard, this disparity can lead to the production of chemicals called organic hydroperoxides.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tOrganic hydroperoxides already exist in nature. In rural areas and other regions that lack large amounts of engine exhaust - and therefore places where nitric oxide levels are exceedingly low - the molecules can form when trees off-gas volatile organic compounds that then interact with sunlight.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tThe team led by Wennberg found, however, that there is another chemical pathway for forming organic hydroperoxides - one that occurs at nitric oxide levels substantially higher than can be found in the atmosphere over unpopulated regions.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t\"This is chemistry that does not exist in any of the models of how nitric oxide and hydrocarbons interact,\" says Wennberg, Caltech's R. Stanton Avery Professor of Atmospheric Chemistry and Environmental Science and Engineering and director of the Ronald and Maxine Linde Center for Global Environmental Science.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tSignificantly, the atmospheric nitric oxide concentrations over Los Angeles and in urban regions across the country are now dropping to the levels at which this process - called gas-phase autoxidation - occurs.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tGas-phase autoxidation takes place when there are not enough nitric oxide molecules for hydrocarbons to react with. As a result, hydrocarbon molecules react with themselves. Gas-phase autoxidation has been observed in other settings - for example, the process can form skin-irritating organic hydroperoxides in certain cosmetic products that have gone bad and causes butter to go rancid and wine to spoil. But researchers had thought that it could not occur in the atmosphere, given current urban nitric oxide concentrations. Wennberg and colleagues have found otherwise.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t\"As these nitric oxide concentrations go down by another factor of two over the next five to seven years, we're going to start making more and more organic hydroperoxides in urban areas,\" Wennberg says. In the air, these hydroperoxides are known to form particulates - aerosols.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t\"The problem is that we haven't seen large concentrations of hydroperoxides in heavily populated areas, so we don't know how the formation of gas and aerosol hydroperoxides will impact public health. But we do know that breathing in particles tends to be bad for you,\" he says.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<!--FACEBOOK-->\n<\/p>","remarks":"","source":"太空新闻日报","isusetime":"2018-02-18 04:35:29","pkey":682,"type":"P","imgpath":"http://pyspider-crawl-image-v01.oss-cn-qingdao.aliyuncs.com/spacedaily.com/2018/01/628f1c1b56291985d978368fd5a06be60.jpg?x-oss-process=image/resize,m_mfit,h_150,w_200","iskey":"N","selftype":"P","description":"An imbalance between the trends in two common air pollutants is unexpectedly triggering the creation of a class of airborne organic compounds not usually found in the atmosphere over urban areas of North America, according to a new study from Caltech.","headImg":"","userid":0,"comnum":1,"vtime":"","imgArray":[],"thumbsUpNum":1,"shareNum":0,"collectionNum":0}]

             * translateTitle :
             * content : <p>
             Thales Alenia Space has signed three contracts in the frame of Next Space Technologies for Exploration Partnerships (NextSTEP-2) activities with Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Orbital-ATK, to develop capabilities that can meet NASA human space exploration objectives while also supporting industry commercialization plans.
             </p>
             <p>
             Based on a public-private partnership model, the next step for human spaceflight is the development of deep space exploration capabilities to expand architectures to support more extensive missions in the proving ground around and beyond cis-lunar space and then towards deep space and, ultimately, Mars.
             </p>
             <p>
             In addition NASA hopes to incorporate modules and parts developed in the NextSTEP project into the follow on Deep Space Gateway and Deep Space Transport projects. An important part of NASA's strategy is to stimulate the commercial space industry while leveraging those same commercial capabilities through partnerships to deliver mission capabilities.
             </p>
             <p>
             In this frame, Thales Alenia Space has collaborated with a couple of the selected US Companies, namely Orbital ATK and Lockheed Martin, since the very beginning of NextSTEP. For NextSTEP-2, a third contract has been added with Boeing.
             </p>
             <p>
             Thales Alenia Space support to the US partner's activities in NextSTEP is primarily focused on the definition of a key core element of the Cislunar infrastructure, i.e. the Habitat Module, but with potential additional contributions in terms of general deep space gateway architecture and other composing elements, such as a potential airlock. The support will capitalize on the Thales Alenia Space knowledge and heritage acquired in both exploration and space transportation domains.
             </p>
             <p>
             Thanks to its flight proven know-how and capability accumulated through its strong contribution in the development of the ISS Pressurized Modules (both permanently operative in orbit like the Nodes, or used to support ISS cargo logistic like Cygnus), Thales Alenia Space will provide added values to the US partners by proposing sound and robust design solutions for the new generation exploration modules, where innovation and recent technological steps forwards can be injected as well.
             </p>
             <p>
             In particular, this support will span from overall module configuration to layout, structures, micro-meteoroid and radiation protection, thermal control and more in general systems aspects (including manufacturing and integration capabilities) essential for the technical definition of such modules and for the setup of development approach and planning able to meet the stringent schedule of the program.
             </p>
             <p>
             "We are very proud to bring our expertise to cooperate with NASA in expanding the frontiers of knowledge, capability and opportunities in space beyond Low Earth Orbit" - declared Walter Cugno Vice President Domain Exploration and Science Thales Alenia Space - "For Thales Alenia Space, the partnering with US companies in this very exciting adventure is also the culmination of a unique knowhow developed through European banner and now recognized worldwide".

However, it\u2019s important to be able to track this wastewater to ensure it doesn\u2019t end up in unwanted places. A group of Canadian scientists has found an unlikely solution.\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<!-- image slider for small images -->\n<div class=\"un-nw-full\">\n\t<p>\n\t\tTracing where this water ends up is hard to measure: What\u2019s something found in all wastewater that will allow us to account for all of it? The answer, of all things, is artificial sweeteners. These have several advantages over other compounds sometimes used to track wastewater in the environment.\n\t<\/p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\u201cThey are very specific to wastewater and have very few other possible sources in the environment,\u201d explains John Spoelstra, a research scientist with Environment and Climate Change Canada. \u201cTheir concentrations are often much higher than other wastewater markers and they don\u2019t break down as quickly. This makes them easier to detect. Lastly, they are always present in wastewater. We have never found a wastewater sample that didn\u2019t have these sweeteners present.\u201d\n\t<\/p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tResearchers looked at water from two sources in rural areas near Alliston, Ontario. The first was domestic water wells, privately-owned wells that supply water to a household. They also considered groundwater seeps, or springs. Using the artificial sweeteners as a flag, they tested to see if septic system water ended up in those sources.\n\t<\/p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tOverall, about 30% of the wells and springs contained one or more of the four sweeteners they searched for. Furthermore, they found 3.4-13.6% of the domestic wells had 1% or more of their water coming from the output of a septic system. This finding for seeps was 2-4.7%. This showed the groundwater contained water from a septic system.\n\t<\/p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\u201cAlthough these sweeteners in groundwater themselves may not be a human health concern, the fact that they are there means there is also wastewater, which may contain other chemicals or bacteria of concern,\u201d Spoelstra adds. \u201cGroundwater often gets to streams and lakes. Therefore the contamination of groundwater can also affect surface water quality. We currently don\u2019t know the effects of artificial sweeteners on most organisms in the water.\u201d\n\t<\/p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tThe researchers add that they didn\u2019t test for bacteria and that these artificial sweeteners are considered safe to eat by the Canadian government. In the area of the study, their results also show the septic systems are not the main source of pollutants such as nitrates, which can also be found in local groundwater.\n\t<\/p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tSeptic systems are common outside of large cities. Waste from a household flows into the septic tank underground where it is treated and broken down by a mixture of bacteria. It\u2019s then released into the soil and may be further filtered or treated there. Eventually, the wastewater may end up in local groundwater.\n\t<\/p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tIn urban areas, wastewater is treated in sewage treatment plants. Although this wastewater is treated before going back into the environment, it still contains artificial sweeteners because they are hard to remove. This is another way they can get into the water supply.\n\t<\/p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\u201cRegular inspection and maintenance of septic systems and groundwater wells should be done to identify and fix possible problems,\u201d adds Spoelstra. \u201cHomeowners should also have their raw well water tested for bacteria at least once per year.\u201d\n\t<\/p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tFor information on the maintenance of septic systems and wells, Spoelstra recommends homeowners consult with local government resources.\n\t<\/p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tRead more about this research in the <em>Journal of Environmental Quality<\/em>.

All that screen time&nbsp;causes&nbsp;eye&nbsp;irritation and dryness, eye strain, blurred or double vision, headache, and shoulder and neck pain.\n\t<\/p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tYou can minimize the risks of damaging your eyes&nbsp;by reducing&nbsp;glare on your screen, upgrading your screen to an LCD, blinking frequently, correcting your posture, and gazing at a distant object every 20 minutes.\n\t<\/p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<strong>Eat a healthy snack.<\/strong><br />\n<br />\nLow blood sugar can make you feel foggy and mentally lethargic.

The answer, of all things, is artificial sweeteners. These have several advantages over other compounds sometimes used to track wastewater in the environment.\n\t<\/p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\u201cThey are very specific to wastewater and have very few other possible sources in the environment,\u201d explains John Spoelstra, a research scientist with Environment and Climate Change Canada. \u201cTheir concentrations are often much higher than other wastewater markers and they don\u2019t break down as quickly. This makes them easier to detect. Lastly, they are always present in wastewater. We have never found a wastewater sample that didn\u2019t have these sweeteners present.\u201d\n\t<\/p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tResearchers looked at water from two sources in rural areas near Alliston, Ontario. The first was domestic water wells, privately-owned wells that supply water to a household. They also considered groundwater seeps, or springs. Using the artificial sweeteners as a flag, they tested to see if septic system water ended up in those sources.\n\t<\/p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tOverall, about 30% of the wells and springs contained one or more of the four sweeteners they searched for. Furthermore, they found 3.4-13.6% of the domestic wells had 1% or more of their water coming from the output of a septic system. This finding for seeps was 2-4.7%. This showed the groundwater contained water from a septic system.\n\t<\/p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\u201cAlthough these sweeteners in groundwater themselves may not be a human health concern, the fact that they are there means there is also wastewater, which may contain other chemicals or bacteria of concern,\u201d Spoelstra adds. \u201cGroundwater often gets to streams and lakes. Therefore the contamination of groundwater can also affect surface water quality. We currently don\u2019t know the effects of artificial sweeteners on most organisms in the water.\u201d\n\t<\/p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tThe researchers add that they didn\u2019t test for bacteria and that these artificial sweeteners are considered safe to eat by the Canadian government. In the area of the study, their results also show the septic systems are not the main source of pollutants such as nitrates, which can also be found in local groundwater.\n\t<\/p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tSeptic systems are common outside of large cities. Waste from a household flows into the septic tank underground where it is treated and broken down by a mixture of bacteria. It\u2019s then released into the soil and may be further filtered or treated there. Eventually, the wastewater may end up in local groundwater.\n\t<\/p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tIn urban areas, wastewater is treated in sewage treatment plants. Although this wastewater is treated before going back into the environment, it still contains artificial sweeteners because they are hard to remove. This is another way they can get into the water supply.\n\t<\/p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\u201cRegular inspection and maintenance of septic systems and groundwater wells should be done to identify and fix possible problems,\u201d adds Spoelstra. \u201cHomeowners should also have their raw well water tested for bacteria at least once per year.\u201d\n\t<\/p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tFor information on the maintenance of septic systems and wells, Spoelstra recommends homeowners consult with local government resources.\n\t<\/p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tRead more about this research in the <em>Journal of Environmental Quality<\/em>.

And some of them are actually kind of fun.\n\t<\/p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tRead on for 10 tips and tricks that can help you make it through the day without that habit-forming caffeine hit.\n\t<\/p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tJulia Calderone wrote the original version of this post.\n\t<\/p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<strong>Look away from the screen.<\/strong><br />\n<br />\nLooking at one target for a long time, such as a computer screen, can hurt&nbsp;your eyes and make you struggle to keep them open.\n\t<\/p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tAs many as 95% of Americans are at risk for so-called computer vision syndrome \u2014 especially&nbsp;those who work in an office. All that screen time&nbsp;causes&nbsp;eye&nbsp;irritation and dryness, eye strain, blurred or double vision, headache, and shoulder and neck pain.\n\t<\/p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tYou can minimize the risks of damaging your eyes&nbsp;by reducing&nbsp;glare on your screen, upgrading your screen to an LCD, blinking frequently, correcting your posture, and gazing at a distant object every 20 minutes.\n\t<\/p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<strong>Eat a healthy snack.<\/strong><br />\n<br />\nLow blood sugar can make you feel foggy and mentally lethargic. Large meals can have the same effect, because digestion takes energy (ahem,&nbsp;food coma). If you try to mask this effect with sugary foods and caffeine, you'll get a momentary high before a rapid crash.\n\t<\/p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tEating small snacks packed with certain nutrients and good fats&nbsp;is a great way to&nbsp;get the benefits of&nbsp;a natural buzz. One study found that a high-fiber breakfast&nbsp;provided the greatest boost in alertness, and high-quality proteins \u2014 like those found in eggs \u2014 are also important. But there are a wide variety&nbsp;of foods that can help keep your energy levels high throughout the day.\n\t<\/p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tSome of our favorite suggestions are avocado toast, peanut butter and celery, or carrots and hummus. Foods like spinach, beans, and lentils are great sources of iron, and iron deficiency is often a source of fatigue. Pairing those iron-rich foods&nbsp;with snacks&nbsp;high&nbsp;in vitamin C will help boost iron absorption.\n\t<\/p>\n\t<div class=\"article-navigation\">\n\t<\/div>\n<\/div>","id":745,"author":"iFLScience","title":"10个小诀窍，帮助你精神抖擞，不再依赖喝咖啡","time":13795,"tree":116,"jca_browse":0,"dateformat":"2018-02-16","unkey":null,"thistype":null,"jca_time":"2018-02-16 23:44:18","artype":"P","comnum":0},{"upman":"B","thissort":null,"des":"国际天文学联合会在诺亚奇斯特拉地区\u201cNeukum\u201d命名了102公里宽的火山口，以纪念德国物理学家和行星科学家。","sort":null,"userid":"","img":"http://pyspider-crawl-image-v01.oss-cn-qingdao.aliyuncs.com/marsdaily.com/2018/01/7e074846465404ed4b6d29c4dbc536450.jpg","lable":"N","vtime":"","headurl":"","content":"<p>\n\tA fascinating martian crater has been chosen to honour the German physicist and planetary scientist, Gerhard Neukum, one of the founders of ESA's Mars Express mission.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tThe International Astronomical Union named the 102 km-wide crater in the Noachis Terra region \"Neukum\" in September last year after the camera's leader, who died in 2014. Professor Neukum inspired and led the development of the high-resolution stereo camera on Mars Express, which helped to establish the regional geology and topography of Mars.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tObservations by the camera in December 2005 and May 2007 were used to create the image mosaic of Neukum Crater presented here.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tNeukum Crater sits in the Noachis Terra region in the densely cratered southern highlands of Mars, some 800 km to the west of the planet's largest impact basin, Hellas. Noachis Terra is one of the oldest known regions on the Red Planet, dating back at least 3.9 billion years - the earliest martian era, the Noachian epoch, is named after it.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tIt is representative of the ancient surface of Mars, which is characteristically peppered with craters that have been preserved for billions of years, although many have degraded over time.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tMany impact craters in Noachis Terra host dune fields, and in this scene, Neukum Crater displays a particularly interesting pattern with dunes covering an area of about 12 x 17 km in the southeast corner of the crater.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tThe individual dunes stretch out in a north-south direction, with the dominant slipface towards the west, pointing to a prevailing wind coming from the east. In addition, dark sands have been blown to the west and north of the dunes, indicative of the strong easterly - and some southerly - winds.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tThe formation of light-toned deposits west of the dune field is unclear: they might be boulders or erosional remnants from the rocky crater interior.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tThe crater's shallow interior has likely been infilled by sediments over its history. It is also marked with two irregular depressions. Perhaps they are a sign of a weaker material that has since eroded away, leaving behind some islands of more resistant material.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tOver time the interior of the crater rim has undergone varying degrees of collapse, with landslides visible in the perspective view. Many smaller craters have also overprinted the rim and pockmarked the interior since Neukum Crater was formed, highlighting its long history.\n<\/p>","id":746,"author":"太空新闻日报","title":"国际天文学联合会以\u201cNeukum\u201d命名火山口,以纪念伟大的德国物理学家和行星科学家","time":13795,"tree":116,"jca_browse":0,"dateformat":"2018-02-16","unkey":null,"thistype":null,"jca_time":"2018-02-16 23:44:19","artype":"P","comnum":0}]

                 </p>
                 <p>
                 For information on the maintenance of septic systems and wells, Spoelstra recommends homeowners consult with local government resources.
